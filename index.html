    <h2> Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p> Progressive enhancement is a standard of web devolpment that is formatted to give an equal experience to all
    users of sites. It is based more on content and accessibility than its counter part standard, graceful degradation.
    Progressive Enhancement truly is vital in modern web devolpment because as web devolpers, we want to ensure that
    all users can receive equal accessibility to our sites and have enjoyable experiences with our sites. Not only
    that, but we also want to ensure that the content of our sites is laid out properly to allow all users the chance
    to have the best experience possible with our sites. I truly believe Progressive Enhancement is an incredible 
    standard and a pivotal stepping stone for future web devolopers to have in store for them.</p>
    <p>Another web article/entry that I found to be interesting is Mozilla's definition of Progressive Enhancement
    and their description of it. <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement"> Mozilla Developer Web Docs: Progressive Enhancement</a></p>

       <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection Assignment</h2>
       <p>I had a very difficult but interesting experience working on the Space X Dragon project. I did not learn the material as I should have originally by not paying as much attention in class as I should have been, and by not truly grasping the material given to me. Once I began working on this project I simply grounded myself better in my overall learning of HTML and CSS by going back and watching lectures and re-learning the material. Once I put in the work to better understand how to create the project I was able to go from there and form my mock page.</p>
       <p>From that point I was able to begin working on my project. When working on my project the main issues I ran into were issues with the spacing and allignment of my text and borders and placing my pictures where they needed to be. I struggled using the CSS to make my text be formatted in a clean and concise manner. Thankfully after some researching and lots of trial and error I was able to come up with my CSS code that allowed each page to look clean and tidy. I also ran into issues with placing the pictures where they needed to be, and more specifically the header picture. Thankfully that issue did not take as much trial and error as my problems with the text formatting, but still was a main issue I struggled with after creating my first layout. </p>
       <p>Through the revision options I was given by Mr. Wallace, my friend Alec, and my mom I was able to add some key changes to the formatting and coloring of my page. I changed the size of my report a problem button in my footer in order to not make it as bold as other header text as was suggested by my mom. I also changed the capitalization of a few of my header texts in order to keep them in order as was suggested by my mom. I also worked to change the background color of my webpage along with the text color to match in order to make the webpage overall a more pleasurable experience for users looking at it as was suggested by Mr. Wallace. I also centered my nav elements in order to keep in form with the rest of my page as was suggested by Mr. Wallace. I was suggested by Mr. Wallace to work on the spacing of my elements, but I unfortunately did not since I struggled so much before with it, although looking back I wish I would have improved on it. Lastly, I changed my learn more buttons to different web links on the space x website as was suggested by my friend Alec.</p>
       <p>This project along with the others we worked on throughout this semester definitely took me on a coding trip that I have never been on before. For some odd reason, HTML and CSS code was just so different than what I was used to with Python, Java, or C++. With this in mind, it took much more out of me to learn this language. Since this language was not as easy for me, my procrastination took a much stronger tole on me than it usually does which helped me better understand how I should work more on attempting to stop my procrastination, especially moving forward with my classes. Overall, I believe I did well on this final project and I am very proud of my work and how far I have come. Truthfully I could not have done it without an amazing instructor so thank you Mr. Wallace for all you have done to help me and many others learn in this course.</p>
